When I was in school, I had a difficult time getting ahold of game sites and proxies. The objective of this project is to help students bypass school filters and play the games they love so they don't have to be bored like I was.
Feel free to contact me to have a chat, provide more links, or give your feedback on what features I should add, as well as what I can do better.;
